                <p>I wrote her off for the tenth time today<br>
                    And practiced all the things I would say<br>
                    But she came over, I lost my nerve<br>
                    I took her back and made her dessert</p>

                <p>Oh, I know I'm being used<br>
                    That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse<br>
                    I know she's playing with me<br>
                    That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem.</p>

                <p>When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me<br>
                    Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends<br>
                    When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease<br>
                    Then I wonder how much more I can spend<br>
                    Well, I guess I should stick up for myself<br>
                    But I really think it's better this way<br>
                    The more you suffer<br>
                    The more it shows you really care<br>
                    Right? Yeah</p>

                <p>Now I'll relate this little bit<br>
                    It happens more than I'd like to admit<br>
                    Late at night, she knocks on my door<br>
                    She's drunk again and looking to score</p>

                <p>Oh, I know I should say no<br>
                    But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go<br>
                    I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb<br>
                    I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem</p>
